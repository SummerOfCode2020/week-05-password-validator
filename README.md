# Password Validator

## Instructions
In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with a basic project setup as well as a set of tests which currently fail. 

Your task is to create a `validatePassword` function which will return true when the password given meets all the listed requirements listed below.

Working in a branch called `answer`, implement your function to get your tests to pass. Once you are done, push your branch up to GitHub, create a pull request, and request review from the instructor.

## Password Rules
* Must be a minimum of 8 characters
* Must contain at least one lower case letter
* Must contain at least one upper case letter
* Must contain at least one numeric value
* Must contain at least one special character
